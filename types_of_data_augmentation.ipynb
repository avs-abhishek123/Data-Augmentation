Although the technique can be applied in a variety of domains, it's very common in Computer Vision, and this will be the focus of the tutorial.\n\nAdjustments are made to the original images in the training dataset before being used in training. Some example adjustments include translating, croping, scaling, rotating, changing brightness and contrast. We do this to reduce the dependence of the model on spurious characteristics; e.g. training data may only contain faces that fill 1/4 of the image, so the model trainied without data augmentation might unhelpfully learn that faces can only be of this size.\n\nAfter defining some utility functions to visualise the example images, this tutorial details each different augmentation that can be used to adjust both the position and the colors of images.

You can instead specify the augmentation steps in the constructor of the `ImageIter`, using the `aug_list` argument or `**kwargs`, and the dimension ordering will be handled for you.\n\n__Note__: Some implicit augmentation may occur when using `ImageIter`. You must specify the `data_shape` in the constructor of the `ImageIter`, and if the height and width are different from the image source, it crops and/or scales. Scaling is applied equally in both height and width axes so image isn't streched.\n\n\n#### 2) What channel order should be used when using Augmenters?\n\nMXNet's default is Red, Green, Blue (RGB), while OpenCV's default is Blue, Green, Red (BGR).\n\n\n#### 3) What value ranges should be used when using Augmenters?\n\nMost Augmenters don't require values of a certain range. Some Augmenters (such as `mxnet.image.ResizeAug` and `mxnet.image.BrightnessJitterAug`) can output images with a larger value range than the input though. An example of this would be an image with values 0 to 255, where pixels already close to the range boundary might be shifted outside of the 0 to 255 range by a random brightness jitter. You'll notice that the `plot_mx_array` function clips values outside of the 0 to 255 range.\n\n#### 4) Are augmentations performed on GPU?\n\nMost of the augmenters contain a mixture of control logic and `NDArray` operations. Although `NDArray` operations can be run on GPU, the control logic will still run on CPU which may limit performance. With Gluon DataLoaders you can specify `num_workers` to perform loading and augmentation in parallel with multiprocessing workers.\n\n#### 4) Can I implement custom augmentations?\n\nYes, you can implement your own class that inherits from [`Augmenter`](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/image/image.html?highlight=augmenter#mxnet.image.Augmenter) and define the augmentation steps in the `__call__` method. You can also implement a `dumps` method which returns a string representation of the augmenter and its parameters: it's used when inspecting a list of `Augmenter`s.\n\n<!-- INSERT SOURCE DOWNLOAD BUTTONS -->\n\n", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}], "metadata": {"display_name": "", "name": "", "language": "python"}, "nbformat_minor": 2}
